# Baremetal_RTOS_Kernel
This repository hosts essential components of a RTOS tailored for ARM Cortex-M4 processors on a STM microcontroller. It encompasses fundamental building blocks such as Thread Control Blocks (TCBs), Thread Context Switching mechanisms, Round-Robin and Cooperative scheduling algorithms, as well as Semaphore-based thread synchronization mechanisms.
